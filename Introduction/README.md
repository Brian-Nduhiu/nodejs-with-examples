# Introduction & Setup

Node.js is a powerful and popular runtime environment that allows developers to build fast, scalable, and efficient server-side applications using JavaScript. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by Google Chrome, and provides a rich set of tools and modules for developing web applications, network servers, and command-line tools.

To set up Node.js, you first need to download and install it on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org). Once downloaded, simply run the installation file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Node.js on your machine.

After installation, you can verify that Node.js is working correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `node -v`. This should output the version of Node.js that you have installed.

To start building applications with Node.js, you will also need a code editor or IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text. Once you have your editor set up, you can create a new project directory and start writing your first Node.js application.

Overall, Node.js is a powerful tool for building scalable, efficient, and modern web applications. With its vast ecosystem of modules and tools, it provides developers with everything they need to build robust server-side applications using JavaScript.
